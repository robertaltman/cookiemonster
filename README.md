# Cookie Monster

A simple bit of JavaScript to delete cookies.

## Why this exists

Sometimes you have too many cookies on a domain and need to delete them for some sites to work properly.

## How to use

* Reference the sample [cookiemonster/index.html](cookiemonster/index.html) and [cookiemonster/index-bootstrap.html](cookiemonster/index-bootstrap.html) files.
* Check out [cookiemonster/nomnom.js](cookiemonster/nomnom.js) to see how it works.
* Modify and make your own versions as needed.

### Prerequisites

The code needs to run on a domain that has access to the cookies you want to delete.
